# Mastering OpenCV 3 - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering OpenCV 3 - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-opencv-3-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467171), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will put you straight to work in creating powerful and unique computer vision applications. Each chapter is structured around a central project and deep dives into an important aspect of OpenCV such as facial recognition, image target tracking, making augmented reality applications, the 3D visualization framework, and machine learning. Youâ€™ll learn how to make AI that can remember and use neural networks to help your applications learn.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Each chapter of the book is for a separate project. Therefore there are 7 projects for the 7 chapters (note that the 1st edition of the book also had a 9th chapter, only in the eBook).

You can run each project separately, they each contain a README.md text file describing how to build that project, using CMake in most cases, because CMake can be used with many compilers and many operating systems.

To build & run the projects for the book:
* Install OpenCV (version 3.1.0 is recommended, whereas OpenCV 2 is only supported in the 1st edition of this book). eg: go to http://opencv.org/, click on Downloads, download the latest OpenCV 3.1 version (including prebuilt library), and extract it to "C:\OpenCV" for Windows or ~/OpenCV for Linux. In OpenCV v3.1.0, the prebuilt OpenCV library is in C:\OpenCV\build or ~/OpenCV/build, such as C:\OpenCV\build\x64\vc9 for MS Visual Studio 2008 (or vs10 folder for MS Visual Studio 2010, or the x86 parent folder for 32-bit Windows).
* Install all the source code of the book. eg: extract the code to "C:\MasteringOpenCV" for Windows or "~/MasteringOpenCV" for Linux.
* Install CMake v2.8 or later from http://www.cmake.org/.

The code will look like the following:
```
int cameraNumber = 0;
if (argc> 1)
  cameraNumber = atoi(argv[1]);
  // Get access to the camera.
cv::VideoCapture capture
```

you will also need a computer, and IDE of your choice (such as Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, or QtCreator, running on Windows, Mac, or Linux). Some chapters have further requirements, in particular:

* To develop an OpenCV program for Raspberry Pi, you will need the Raspberry Pi device, its tools, and basic Raspberry Pi development experience.
* Several desktop projects require a webcam connected to your computer. Any common USB webcam should suffice, but a webcam of at least 1 megapixel may be desirable.
* CMake is used in some projects, including OpenCV itself, to build across operating systems and compilers. A basic understanding of build systems is required, and knowledge of cross-platform building is recommended.

An understanding of linear algebra is expected, such as basic vector and matrix operations, and eigen decomposition.
